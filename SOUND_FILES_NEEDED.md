3. Place all files in the `public/sounds/` directory
4. Test each sound using the preview button in the settings panel

## Current Existing Sounds

These sounds are already in `public/sounds/`:

Make sure your new sounds are more noticeable than these existing relaxing sounds.

3. Click settings (gear icon)
4. Open the Sound dropdown
5. Click the preview button (â–¶) for each new sound
6. Verify all 14 sounds play correctly

## Notes

- The application will attempt to play these sounds even if they don't exist (but will fail silently)
- All translations are already implemented (English/Japanese)
- The UI is fully responsive across mobile/tablet/desktop
- Volume control applies to all sounds
