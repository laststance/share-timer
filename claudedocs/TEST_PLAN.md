# Share Timer Test Plan

_Last updated: 2025-10-08_

## 1. Objectives

- Validate that the Share Timer PWA delivers reliable countdown, notification, and audio playback functionality across supported browsers and devices.
- Ensure the newly sourced notification sounds are unique, normalized, and selectable within the app.
- Provide a repeatable cadence for regression and release testing, including automated and manual coverage.

## 2. Scope

### In Scope

- Timer countdown lifecycle (start / pause / resume / reset).
- Time input validation (1–99 minutes, numeric constraints).
- Sound selector, audio playback, and volume control (including new presets).
- Web notifications (permission flow, background firing, service worker registration).
- Settings panel behavior and persistence via Zustand/localStorage.
- Internationalization (en, ja) and locale routing.
- PWA installability, offline caching, and shortcut actions.
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA focus, screen reader announcements, keyboard support).
- Responsive layouts (mobile, tablet, desktop breakpoints).

### Out of Scope

- Native mobile application stores or standalone mobile builds.
- Backend push gateway infrastructure beyond the mock notification flow shipped in the repo.
- Third-party analytics integrations (none currently configured).

## 3. Test Strategy

| Test Type               | Goals                                                                                       | Primary Owner | Automation Tooling                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Unit                    | Validate isolated logic (stores, hooks, utilities).                                         | Dev           | Vitest (add), React Testing Library |
| Component / Integration | Ensure components integrate with Zustand, AudioManager, notification APIs.                  | Dev / QA      | Vitest + RTL, MSW mocks             |
| End-to-End              | Validate full user flows in real browsers (timer lifecycle, notifications, settings, i18n). | QA            | Playwright (existing e2e specs)     |
| Accessibility           | Confirm keyboard navigation, aria roles, and screen reader text.                            | QA            | Axe DevTools, Manual VoiceOver/NVDA |
| Performance / PWA       | Lighthouse audits, service worker cache verification, offline smoke.                        | QA            | Lighthouse CLI, Chrome DevTools     |

### 5.6 Regression Guardrails

- Run full smoke checklist on each PR touching timer, audio, notification, or store logic.
- Execute accessibility and localization suites for release candidates.
- Maintain screenshot diffs (Playwright trace viewer artifacts already stored under `playwright-report/`).

## 6. Automation Coverage

Existing Playwright specs:

- `e2e/accessibility.spec.ts`
- `e2e/sound.spec.ts`
- `e2e/timer-behavior.spec.ts`

Action items:

1. Extend `e2e/sound.spec.ts` to iterate over all 14 presets and assert that audio sources resolve (no 404) and filenames match the new list.
2. Add new test for notification pop audio playback at completion (mock timers + AudioManager spy).
3. Parameterize locale coverage by running e2e smoke in both `en` and `ja` contexts.
4. Integrate Playwright CI job into release pipeline (GitHub Actions or pnpm script).

Unit/integration backlog:

- Add Vitest suite for `lib/audio/audioManager.ts` (load, play, stop).
- Add store tests for `useSettingsStore` covering persistence and bounds.
- Introduce MSW-based tests for notification API routes.

## 7. Performance & Monitoring

- Run Lighthouse (Desktop & Mobile) aiming for PWA score ≥ 90.
- Measure first input delay after install (<100 ms).
- Monitor console/network logs for service worker registration issues.

## 8. Test Schedule

| Phase             | Purpose                                   | Frequency                         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| PR Validation     | Run Playwright smoke + lint               | On every PR                       |
| Nightly           | Run full Playwright suite + Lighthouse    | Daily while in active development |
| Release Candidate | Full manual regression (Sections 5.2–5.5) | Prior to tagged release           |
| Post-Release      | PWA install + notification sanity         | Within 24h of deploy              |

## 9. Entry / Exit Criteria

**Entry**

- Feature flagged or merged into `main`.
- All blockers from previous cycle resolved.

**Exit**

- All high/critical defects closed or deferred with approval.
- Smoke, localization, and accessibility suites pass.
- PWA install verified on at least one desktop and one mobile device.
- Documentation (SOUND_FILES_NEEDED.md, README) updated for new assets.

## 10. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                                      | Impact                         | Mitigation                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Browser autoplay restrictions mute sounds | Completion notification silent | Ensure user interaction before playback; document enabling sound in onboarding |
| Push notifications blocked by user        | Timer completes silently       | Provide in-app banner to enable notifications; rely on audio as fallback       |
| Service worker caching stale assets       | Old sounds served              | Version assets via Next.js build hashes; run cache busting on release          |
| Localization regressions                  | Mixed-language UI              | Automated locale smoke + double QA sign-off                                    |

## 11. Reporting

- Track defects in GitHub issues with labels: `bug`, `area:timer`, `area:audio`, `priority:P0-P2`.
- Summarize test execution in release notes (pass/fail rate, outstanding issues).
